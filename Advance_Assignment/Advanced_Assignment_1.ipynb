    "\n",
    ">   * <b> Modularity and Reusability </b>: breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable objects. These objects can be reused in different parts of a program or in other projects, making code more modular and reducing duplication. <br>\n",
    ">   * <b> Encapsulation </b>: bundling data and related methods into a single unit (an object). It improves code maintainability.\n",
    ">   * <b> Abstraction </b>: define classes that represent abstract concepts and hide the implementation details, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. \n",
    ">   * <b> Inheritance </b>: Derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from their base classes, allowing code reuse and promoting a hierarchical structure. \n",
    ">   * <b> Polymorphism </b>: different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways, based on their specific implementations. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity."
