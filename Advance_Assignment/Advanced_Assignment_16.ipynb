It is equivalent to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n",

It specifies a range of characters that are not allowed in the expression.    **Example**: [^0-9] represents any character that is not a digit. It matches any character other than 0 to 9.\n",
    "> * **Backslash (\\)**: The backslash character is used as an escape character to treat the following character literally. It allows you to include characters that have special significance in the range expression.   **Example**: \"[ \\ [ \\ ] ]\" represents a character class containing only square brackets.
