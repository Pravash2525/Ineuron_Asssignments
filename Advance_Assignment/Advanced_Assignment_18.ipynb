In big-endian, the most significant byte is stored first, and in little-endian, the least significant byte is stored first. \n",
    "> * **Data loss**: If you are not careful, you could lose data when you are reading and writing binary integers. For example, if you are reading a 32-bit integer from a file that is only 24 bits long, you will lose the 8 most significant bits of the integer.\n",
