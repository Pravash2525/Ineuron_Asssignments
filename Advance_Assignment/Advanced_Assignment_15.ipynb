    "> Python 3.8 was released on October 14, 2019, and it included a number of new features and improvements. Here are some of the most notable new features:\n",
    "> * **Assignment expressions**: Assignment expressions are a new way to assign values to variables. \n",
    "> * **Positional-only arguments**: Positional-only arguments are a new way to define arguments that cannot be passed by keyword. This can help to make code more concise and easier to read.\n",
    "> * **Type hints**: Type hints are a way to annotate the types of variables and expressions. This can help to improve the readability and maintainability of code.\n",
    "> * **f-strings**: f-strings are a new way to format strings. They are more concise and easier to read than the old format string syntax.\n",
    "> * **Parallel iterators**: Parallel iterators are a new way to iterate over iterables in parallel. This can improve the performance of code that iterates over large datasets.\n"
