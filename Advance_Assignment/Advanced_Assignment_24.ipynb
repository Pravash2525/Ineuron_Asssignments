    "> * **Scope**: A module has a scope that determines where its objects can be accessed from. The scope of a module is the entire Python interpreter.\n",
    "> * **Importability**: A module can be imported into other modules. This allows modules to share code and data.\n",
    "> * **Reusability**: A module can be reused in multiple applications. This makes modules a powerful way to organize code and make it easier to maintain.\n",
    "> * **Documentation**: A module can have documentation that describes its purpose and usage. This documentation can be helpful for users who want to learn how to use the module.\n"

    "> Tips on how to create a program that avoids mutual importing are:\n",
    "> * **Use explicit imports**: Instead of importing modules implicitly, use explicit imports. This means that you should explicitly list the modules that you want to import, and you should avoid using the from module import * syntax.\n",
    "> * **Use a single entry point**: If you have multiple modules that need to interact with each other, you should use a single entry point. This means that you should have a single module that imports all of the other modules and then exposes the functionality of those modules to the rest of the program.\n",
    "> * **Use lazy imports**: Lazy imports are a way to defer the import of a module until it is actually needed. This can help to avoid circular imports, because the module will not be imported until it is actually needed.\n",
    "> * **Use a package**: A package is a way to organize modules into a hierarchy. This can help to avoid circular imports, because the modules in a package will not be imported unless they are explicitly imported.\n"
