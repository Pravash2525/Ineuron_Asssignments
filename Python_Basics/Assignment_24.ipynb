    "> Some benefits of using lambda expressions:\n",
    "> * __They are concise__: Lambda expressions are much shorter than def statements, which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain.\n",
    "> * __They are anonymous__: Lambda expressions do not have a name, which can be useful in situations where you only need to define a function for a short period of time.\n",
    "> * __They are flexible__: Lambda expressions can be used as arguments to other functions, which can give you more flexibility in your code.\n",
    "> * __Functional Programming__: Lambda expressions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms where functions are treated as first-class citizens. They can be used with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), reduce(), or as arguments to functions like sort(), sorted(), and max().\n",
    "> * __Readability__: Lambda expressions can enhance the readability of your code by keeping the function logic close to the place where it is used. This is particularly useful when the function is short and the intention is clear.\n"

    "> * __Modularity and Reusability__: Design functions to be modular and reusable. Make functions self-contained and independent of the global state whenever possible.\n",
    "> * __Function Documentation__: Provide clear and concise documentation for functions, including a description of the purpose, expected input parameters, return values, and any exceptions or side effects.\n",
    "> * __Error Handling__: Consider proper error handling within functions. Catch and handle expected exceptions, provide meaningful error messages, and document any potential error scenarios.\n",
