When you use logging, the output is a structured object that contains information about the message, such as the level, the source, and the timestamp. This makes it easier to filter, search, and analyze the logging messages.\n",
    " * __Logging messages can be redirected__: By default, logging messages are printed to the console. However, you can also redirect logging messages to a file, a database, or an email address. This allows you to keep a record of your logging messages, even if your program crashes or terminates unexpectedly.\n",
    " * __Logging messages can be filtered__: You can filter logging messages based on their level, source, or other criteria. This allows you to focus on the logging messages that are most relevant to you.\n",
    " * __Logging messages can be formatted__: You can format logging messages to make them more readable and easier to understand. For example, you can format the messages with timestamps, colors, or other special characters.\n"
