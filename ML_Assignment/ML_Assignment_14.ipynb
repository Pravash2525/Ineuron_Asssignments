    "> Three advantages of the decision tree approach are:\n",
    "> * **Interpretability**: Decision trees are interpretable, which means that we can understand how the model makes its predictions. This can be helpful for debugging the model and understanding why it makes certain predictions.\n",
    "> * **Robustness to noise**: Decision trees are robust to noise, which means that they can still perform well even if the data contains some noise. This is because decision trees are able to learn from multiple features, which helps to reduce the impact of noise on the model.\n",
    "> * **Scalability**: Decision trees are scalable, which means that they can be used to train models on large datasets. This is because decision trees are relatively simple algorithms that do not require a lot of memory or processing power.\n"

    "> The three flaws in the decision tree process are:\n",
    "> * **Overfitting**: Decision trees can be overfitting, which means that they can memorize the training data too well and not generalize well to new data. This can happen if the decision tree is too complex or if the training data is not representative of the real world.\n",
    "> * **Lack of interpretability**: Decision trees can be difficult to interpret, especially for large trees. This can make it difficult to understand how the model makes its predictions. This can be a problem if you need to explain the results of the model to stakeholders.\n",
    "> * **Sensitivity to the choice of features**: The performance of decision trees can be sensitive to the choice of features. This means that it is important to choose the features carefully. If the features are not predictive of the target variable, then the decision tree will not be able to make accurate predictions.\n"
